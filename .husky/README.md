# Git Hook Automation

Git hooks can help reduce the need to perform redundant tasks, allowing
developers to focus on building code that matters.

Automation is in place that is aimed at allowing developers to focus on what
matters.

- Code MUST be automatically pushed on commit.
- Packages MUST be automatically installed on pull.
