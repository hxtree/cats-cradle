Welcome to the open-source platform for enterprise architecture! This repository
houses a collection of event-driven microservices, built on a powerful Platform
as a Service (PaaS) foundation. The integration of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
ensures a streamlined DevOps pipeline for continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) leverage the power of AWS.

## Overview

This monorepo is designed to provide a modular and scalable architecture for
enterprises looking to embrace modern software development practices. The use of
event-driven microservices enables flexibility, scalability, and responsiveness
to changing business needs.

## Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture:** The repository is organized into modular
  microservices, each focusing on specific business functionalities. This design
  promotes maintainability, scalability, and ease of deployment.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Leveraging a PaaS foundation simplifies
  infrastructure management and allows developers to focus on writing code
  without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- **Event-Driven Design:** The microservices communicate through events,
  allowing for loosely coupled components and enabling efficient handling of
  business processes.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire infrastructure is defined as
  code, allowing for version control, easy replication, and consistent
  environments across different stages of the development lifecycle.

- **DevOps CI/CD:** The repository includes a robust DevOps pipeline for
  continuous integration and continuous deployment. Automated testing, build,
  and deployment processes ensure a smooth and reliable software delivery
  lifecycle.

While specific services and packages are actively maintained for the development
of Cats Cradle, a nostalgic co-op RPG, the repository functions as a foundation
for architecting monorepos. Services are individually released. Libraries are
published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40cats-cradle).

## Getting Started

For a turn-key development environment,
[fork the repo](https://github.com/hxtree/cats-cradle/fork) and open in Github
Codespaces.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=438855397)

Alternatively, build, test, and deploy apps locally using the
[devcontainer](docs/devcontainer.md).

### Pull Request Lifecycle (~5 mins)

1. Checkout a new branch from main using git.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/improve-readme
   ```

2. Work on changes (e.g. fix a bug or add a new feature). Test-driven
   development encouraged.

   ```bash
   rushx dev
   rushx test
   ```

3. Stage and commit changes using
   [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification).

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m 'doc: fix spelling of computers'
   ```

4. (Optional) If changing a library that is published to NPM, document
   [semantic version](https://semver.org/) changes, generate Changelogs, and
   commit changes.

   ```bash
   rush change
   rush version --bump
   git commit -m 'chore: bump change log'
   ```

5. Push code and open a PR. Celebrate contributing to @cats-cradle.

   ```bash
   git push
   ```
