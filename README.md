Explore this opinionated approach to jumpstart your enterprise application
development. Adopt modern DevOps practices on AWS with a monorepo architecture
like this one to expedite your software pipeline. This repository goes beyond
theory‚Äîit's a hands-on showcase, containing diverse placeholder packages
actively employed in developing a cooperative RPG.

## Getting Started

Instantly start a turn-key development environment by

## Infrastructure

### Architecture

This repository houses a collection of event-driven microservices, built on a
powerful Platform as a Service (PaaS) foundation. The integration of
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ensures a streamlined DevOps pipeline for
continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) leveraging the power of
AWS.
