# Contracts

This folder contains contracts defining interactions, APIs, and shared data
structures used across microservices within the @galaxyops ecosystem.

Contracts serves as a centralized location for defining guidelines and
agreements that facilitate communication and interoperability between different
services and components.

## Contents

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Plain data structures used for transferring
  data between different layers of the system or between microservices.

- **API Contracts**: Specifications defining endpoints, request/response
  formats, and authentication mechanisms for interacting with various
  microservices.

- **Event Schemas**: Definitions of events and messages used for asynchronous
  communication and event-driven architectures.

## Usage

Developers and teams within the @galaxyops ecosystem should use these contracts
when:

- Designing new microservices or components that need to communicate with
  existing services.

- Consuming APIs or integrating with existing microservices.

## Guidelines

- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning principles for changes to ensure
  compatibility across services. Increment the version number when making
  backward-incompatible changes.

- **Documentation**: Each contract should be well-documented with clear
  descriptions, examples, and usage guidelines to facilitate understanding and
  adoption.

- **Consistency**: Maintain naming conventions, data formats, and error handling
  consistency across all contracts to promote interoperability and ease of
  integration.
