# Coding Standards

All coding standards are written to conform to
[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

1. Typescript files SHOULD adhere to Eslint settings.

2. Typescript filenames MUST use Pascal case.

   Good:

   ```bash
   BlackAndWhite.ts
   ```

   Bad:

   ```bash
   blackandwhite.ts
   black-and-white.ts
   ```

3. All folder names SHOULD be snake case or kebab case.

   Good:

   ```bash
   black-and-white
   black
   ```

   Bad:

   ```bash
   blackandwhite
   BlackAndWhtite
   ```
