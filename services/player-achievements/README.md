In video gaming, an achievement (or a trophy) is a meta-goal defined outside a
game's parameters, a digital reward that signifies a player's mastery of a
specific task or challenge within a video game.

Achievements are coupled to the player; not the instance. A Player could join an
instance and all party members within that instance could earn an achievement.

A Player may only have 1 trophy for each type achievement.
