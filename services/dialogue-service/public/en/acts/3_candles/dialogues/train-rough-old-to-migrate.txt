(Battle can go how you want, however this battle does need to be noise to alert the other bandits)
Malace began chanting something,
a huge hellish bull shot out of him and smashed the bandits through the side of the train.
The compartment had been completely smashed up and a huge hole was left in the side of the train.
*/
>> “Yeah I’m sure no one heard that,” Meeku said out loud as he got to his feet,
> “You sure? I was sure that no one would hear that…” Malace replied and smiled. Meeku paused in surprised of this reply,
>> “Come on let’s move,” Meeku stepped out of the compartment into the corridor, (player controlled, can thrown in a few bandit fights) he could hear footsteps coming towards them. Meeku and Malace ran down to the front of the train. They came to a dead end,
> “Ok, now what?” Malace asked, Meeku glanced around looking for a way out,
>> “This is great Meeku, you lead us down here and trap us well…” Malace turned Meeku had gone, “Malace over here,” Meeku head was hanging down in the window outside,
> “You charge through the front and keep them occupied while I go round the back and flank them,” Malace place his hand on his chin and went into a thinking position,
>> “Great plan in all but one small detail, but I think I’ve sussed it. How about you go through the front and I go round the back and flank them.” Malace told him,
> “To late good luck,” Meeku’s head disappeared. Malace turned to face a group of bandits. They had their weapons drawn,
>> “The welcoming committee, hey guys. I was wondering if you would let me go after all I have nothing of any use to you,” The bandits stood confused at this for a second. Malace charged into battle. (party Meeku, player controlled part) Meeku began making his way across the roof of the train; he could hear Malace going crazy below,
> “Watch it Malace, at the rate your going there will be no train left to save!” Meeku said out loud. A couple of bandits came onto the roof, most likely planning on doing what Meeku was doing to them.
>> “Hey what you doing up here?” one of the bandits asked, Meeku paused and drew his sword,
> “Out of my way,” (Battle, party Meeku) )Meeku charged forward and landed a kick to one of the bandits in the stomach. He raised his sword and blocked the others attack, Meeku leg swepted the other, the bandit hit the floor and rolled off the side of the train. A couple of bandits where standing around talking inside the train, until one saw a bandit fall past the window,
>> “What the hell, someone’s on the roof lets move,” (Starts with Battle party Malace, then the next part happens player controlled, find somewhere to go before the next wave arrives, if not done in time next wave comes and the player will have to fight them and then look for a way forward) Malace found himself running out of ideas, he pulled out his daggers and threw one at the window leading to the driver’s compartment and he jumped through. He looked around before deciding to slam on the brakes. (Party Meeku) Meeku felt himself thrown backwards and slammed hard a few times on the roof of the train, someone had thrown on the brakes. Meeku slowly got to his feet, his body now ached all over. He looked over the side, Malace was running along the side of the train.
> “What the hell Malace?” Meeku exclaimed out loud,
>> “Hey you stop where you are or I will kill you,” Meeku turned a group of bandits stood there, Meeku put his hand behind his head to make a chance at grabbing his sword, it wasn’t there. Meeku glanced to his left, it was sticking out of the top train,
> “Damnit.” He rolled to his left avoid a few throwing daggers and grabbed his sword. (Battle Party Meeku) Another knife came at him it slammed into the armour on his shoulder. Meeku grabbed the knife and threw it back, it hit a bandit squarely between the eyes. Meeku charged forward deflected a few more knifes before proceeding to take out the other bandits. (Player controlled party Malace) Malace made his way along the side of the train, he jumped up and pulled himself into the hole he had made in the train, he began making his way to the back of the train where everyone was being held. He didn’t have much time the bandits would stick around much longer and they couldn’t keep them occupied forever. (Player can look around for items etc or go straight with the storyline) Malace reached the next compartment,
>> “Damnit, need to find a key.” Malace exclaimed out loud. (Player controlled, search for key) Malace begins storming through the compartments looking desperately for the key. In the third compartment he finds a metal case with a number lock on it (holding a good item or anything else you think could go in it, I was thinking maybe something that can be used later in the game to unlock a super boss or treasure or ultimate weapon), he continues to search until he finds the key hidden under the mattress of the compartment bed, he sighed
> “A damn kid’s hiding place,” He began to walk out of the compartment. Malace stopped (Player choice search for metal case lock or carry on to the passengers, if player looks for code they get the item however Meeku has to take out the last bandits on his own and if they decide not to then Meeku and Malace fight the last bandits together.)
**Option 1**
“Meeku can handle them for awhile. After all his the one who hasn’t had to do any fighting yet.” Malace runs back down the compartments looking for something to help him unlock the case. He comes into a compartment littered in paper,
>> “Hmm, a bit cliché but I’m sure I can find a clue here somewhere,” he looks through a few when he comes across a page, he reads through,
> “The case lock, now lets see. Digit one, ‘There are a certain number of days in a year and add up to a three digit number, the final digit will serve you well as long as you take a leap. Oh hell, damn riddles. Here I was hoping for a simple 4-digit code. The second digit is the same number of sides of a heptagon. Heptagon!? Hell I’ll guess the second one…The third digit is a math problem for you to ponder. Ponder? Who the hell wrote this? (2x + 4) x 10 – 9 = 51 x is what your looking for. Maths…great. The final digit can be founded on your PSP battery _.6v it is the blank. Err PSP battery…what the hell is a PSP? Screw this I’ll guess,” (Player can now go back to the case and attempt to open it. Clues can be changed if need be let me know) Meeku dropped down into the final compartment, a group of bandits are getting ready to leave,
>> “Going somewhere, I’ll tell you what. You drop the stuff you’ve stolen and we’ll let you go.” Meeku told them. The bandits looked at each other and laughed un-controllably, “In case you didn’t notice you’re alone and out numbered,” The bandits drew their swords in unity and a low metallic ringing filled the air.
> “Alone? Heh, my summoner friend will be coming through that door behind you any second now and all he had to do was kill every bandit sent at him on his way here,” The bandits froze and turned to look at the door
>> “Yep that’s right any second…now…err. Now?” The bandits began to laugh and looked away from the door.
> “He ain’t coming,” The bandits begin to advance when,
>> “Stop, I will take care of this you guys get ready to leave,” A huge bandit stepped out from behind the rest, he was carrying two huge swords and had a bow slung over his back. There was no doubting this guy had been through a lot of battles judging by the scars all over his face. Meeku gulped,
> “Now?” Meeku plead fell on wrong ears Malace had abandoned him at a dire time of need. (Boss fight Party Meeku) The battle ended. Meeku and the Bandit leader fell to their knees. The other bandits began to advance on Meeku, suddenly the door on the otherside of the room flew off it hinges hitting the bandit leader in the back. Malace stood in the doorway.
>> “Where the hell have you been Malace?” Meeku asked angily. The bandits dropped what they were doing and ran.
**Option 2**
> “Damn I can’t leave Meeku to face the final lot alone.” Meeku dropped down into the final compartment, a group of bandits are getting ready to leave,
>> “Going somewhere, I’ll tell you what. You drop the stuff you’ve stolen and we’ll let you go.” Meeku told them. The bandits looked at each other and laughed un-controllably, “In case you didn’t notice you’re alone and out numbered,” The bandits drew their swords in unity and a low metallic ringing filled the air.
> “Alone? Heh, my summoner friend will be coming through that door behind you any second now and all he had to do was kill every bandit sent at him on his way here,” The bandits froze, the door a the end of the carriage flew off its hinges and across the room. Malace stood in the doorway a ghost like demon was sticking out of his body, it had huge fists and giant like muscles,
>> “Need some help Meeku?” A huge bandit stepped up, he carried two huge swords and had a bow slung over his back, judging by all his scars he knew how to fight.
> “I will take care of this you guys prepare to leave.” The bandit leader told the rest.
>> “Lets do this.” Malace said. (Boss Bandit leader, Party Meeku, Malace). (After the battle) The leader fell to his knees and the bandits retreated.
The remaining guards take care of the bandit leader.
> “Could you two please follow me.” A man who was well dressed and looked rich asked. Meeku and Malace nodded and followed. They were taken to a different room.
>> “I must thank you for saving my train from those theifs,” the man thanked them. Malace smiled modestly,
> “No worries piece of cake.” Malace told the man. “Well, for your services to me and my train I would like…” the man glanced around.
 Meeku was looking out of the window as everything that was before shooting past was now slowly moving past.
>> “We’re stopping.” Meeku said. Malace walked up and stood by the window,
> “Damn it, we in the middle of no where.” The man stepped out,
>> “Were’s he going?” Malace asked. A few minutes later the man came back in,
> “I’m sorry but could you go and ask what’s wrong while I talk to the passagers?” Meeku sighed but agreed. (Chance for player to walk round train and talk to people) The pair get to the front of the train.
>> “Hey driver what’s the prob, why we slowing down?” Malace asked as soon as they came into the drivers part of the train.
> “We’re out of fuel, the tanker must have been punctured.” Meeku sighed.
>> “Anyone got a puncture repair kit?” Malace asked. The driver shook his head
> “I can repair the puncture, but we need some fuel.” Meeku and Malace made their way back to the other end of the train.
>> “We’re out of fuel!” the man exclaimed. Meeku nodded, Malacae had sat down,
> “We’re we going to find fuel in the middle of the desert?” Malace stood up.
>> “I guess your best bet would to be follow those bandits to their camp and see if they have any.” Malace explained. Meeku shot Malace an evil look, Malace mouthed ‘what?’.
> “Oh, ok guys good luck you seem to know what your doing. I’ll stay here and man the fort.” The man walked away back to the other passagers to tell them what was going on. “Bandits might have some…” Meeku mocked. Malace shugged his shoulders. (Chance to get ready to leave maybe some people selling goods?) The two friends trek across the waste land following the Bandits trail. After fighting a few battles they come to the place their looking for. The place is being patrolled by bandits.
>> “Ok this is it, do you want to go up and ask or shall I?” Malace joked. Meeku ignored him finding it the best way to deal with Malace in these situations.
> “Ok we’ll have to sneek in,” Meeku told Malace. Malace seemed abit uphappy with this idea but could let it slide. They needed to wait for the right timing to sneak pass the guards. (Mini Game. Sneak pass the guards). When they finally get in the camp is in an uproar as they decide on who the new leader would be. Meeku hid behind a building with Malace,
>> “Now what?” Malace asked. Meeku glanced around everyone seemed to be busy. “Ok now we start to search for fuel while these lot fight over who is leader,” Meeku explained. “Or we could do what they say and not be killed,” Malace replied.
> “We could…what? Oh!” A group of bandits were surrounding them. They are taken out and dumped in the middle of the crowd of bandits.
>> “You guys got a lot of guts coming here.” A bandit spoke, he seemed to be taking some sort of control.
> “Hey I don’t even know why I’m here I don’t even know this guy.” Meeku kicked Malace in his shin,
>> “Oww!” Malace began hopping about.
> “Ok guys since you came all the way down here you can help us decide who the new leader will be.” Malace stopped hopping and smiled,
>> “You can be leader, well that was easy. Any you guys got train fuel?” Malace began straight away.
> “The first one to kill them is leader,” Meeku sighed,
>> “Oh right you meant it like that.” (Battle Bandits. The player fights and defeats them all)
> “This can’t be?” The last bandit said as he fell to his knees. Malace and Meeku stood ready waiting for the next person.
>> “You are now the leaders of our group.” Malace put his weapon away.
> “Oh well in that case, you get some train fuel, you get me some food and water and you two fight to the death.” Meeku smacked Malace round the back of the head.
>> “Don’t listen to him, we don’t want to be your leaders. We just want some train fuel, can we have some?” A group of bandits point to a tent. “There’s some in there,” Meeku nodded. (Player free to do what he wants. Maybe buy some supplies, weapons the sort. Talk to bandits most saying things about the fighting skill of the two party members. Player then makes his way back to the train)
----
Meeku and Malace finally get back to the train with the fuel and hand it over.
> “Here you are, so can we get moving now?” Malace asked. Meeku sat down. A group of train workers took the fuel to refill the train.
>> “Thank you so much. I would like to reward you when we get to our destination. Until then you must be tired, you can rest.” (Player can now talk to people for abit or go straight to sleep. People talk about how grantful they are that the party was on the train. When player goes to sleep they wake up at their destination.)
