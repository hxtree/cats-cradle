Here is the tale of how I gained my freedom. # actorId: LAWZON
During my childhood, I used to dream about riches and my heart's most fervent desires.
However, when I woke up, I was filled with sadness as I realized that all of it was merely a figment of my imagination.
This feeling tormented me as my mind was tempted with things that I knew would never come true.
Eventually, I started to distance myself from my own imagination, separating my mind from the illusions that had held me captive.
