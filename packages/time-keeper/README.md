Time is displayed to the User using a HT format.

HT stands for Hadean Time which is the time period in which the universe began,
5 billion years ago.

Time progresses in reverse. The "-" before the time period indicates that it is
a count down until our universe begins.

Game time should always be going. There should be no downtime while accessing
menus. When a player select a character and goes into thier equipment menu they
adjust it live with while the majority of the screen is visiable.

A pause feature may be used but would freeze all players menu in a game
instance.
