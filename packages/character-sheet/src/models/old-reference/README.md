Entity: An entity represents a general-purpose object. In a game engine context,
for example, every coarse game object is represented as an entity. Usually, it
only consists of a unique id. Implementations typically use a plain integer for
this.

Entities: a unique integer

Entities are only collection of data. No logic, just data. Any entities
functions are helper functions to access data.

Considering dropping the TypeORM, it probably means using it's a bit too
lambdalith.
