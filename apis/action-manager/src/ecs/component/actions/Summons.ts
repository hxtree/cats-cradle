// Summons
// Summons can be called to the battlefield in many different ways and once their can be used in different ways to benefit your party. Just because a summon is present does not mean that it will do as it is told or that your party can control it. Most Summons can only be used with the Command action or through the Interaction Command. Summons have different levels and stats just like characters and the more you use them the more powerful they become.
