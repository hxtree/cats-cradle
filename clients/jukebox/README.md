This services plays only retro music -- so turn up the volume to 11. We're
talking Impulse Tracker (\*.it) files.

> **Note** The audio files maintained by the service are for the Unreal game
> engine to consume. Unreal features ability to play multiple files at once,
> e.g. sound effects. and govern the selection of music selection. That is
> performed by an import; and is not related to this service, which only
> maintains and plays audio files.
