# @org-app/mobile-client

This is an mobile client. It aims to be cross platform mobile support. Android will be the initial focus.

## Requirements

* Unity https://unity.com/download
* Unity Android SDK https://developer.android.com/games/develop/build-in-unity

## Architecture Guidelines

* Although the server side uses JS based microsevices, etc. there isn't much of a marketplace for a JS game client. It's best to use established tools designed for game design to focus on indiferented code. ThreeJS is neat library for generating 3D graphics but Unity seems like it would reduce barrier to marketplace entry.
* There is a healthy marketplace for mobile games to making frontend mobilehttps://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/ , healthy
enough where using a frontend mobile client makes sense. 
* Mobile clients now feature adaquate hardware unlike in 2005.
