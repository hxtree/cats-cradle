## Serverless

Serverless **SHOULD** be selected over persistent containers or bare metal. Our
serverless approach allows us to dynamically scale resources in response to
demand, minimizing idle capacity and reducing costs associated with
over-provisioning.

Additionally, by breaking down our application into smaller, independent
functions, we can optimize resource allocation and mitigate the risk of
bottlenecks or performance issues. Furthermore, our modular architecture enables
us to deploy updates and enhancements to specific components independently,
reducing downtime and accelerating time-to-market.
