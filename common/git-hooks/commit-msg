# This is an example Git hook for use with Rush.  To enable this hook, rename this file

# ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE
#
# The commit-msg hook is called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message.  The hook should exit with non-zero status after issuing
# an appropriate message if it wants to stop the commit.  The hook is allowed to edit
# the commit message file.

# This example enforces that commit message should contain a minimum amount of
# description text.

  echo "Invalid commit message: The message must contain at least 3 words."
