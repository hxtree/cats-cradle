# Hooks Automation

Git hooks can help reduce the need to perform redundant tasks, allowing
developers to focus on building code that matters. Code **MUST** be
automatically pushed on commit, packages **MUST** be automatically installed on
pull. Automation is in place that is aimed at allowing developers to focus on
what matters.
