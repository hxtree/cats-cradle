# @org-contracts

Service Endpoint Contracts are a part of the Microservice API Patterns (MAP).
Contracts are used for to define communication agreements between microservices.

## Updating Contracts

**WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY AUTOGENERATED CONTRACTS**

All contracts are owned by the service that is depended on. All contracts are
automatically generated from the services that is depended on.

1. Bring up the service with openapi endpoint

2. Generate the contract

```bash
sudo openapi-generator-cli generate
```

## Guidelines

Each API version, e.g. `/auth-service/v1/`

Each services contracts should adhere to the following:

```
Queries
* API/Rest/POJO
  query / find, findBy, findAll, get. has
e.g. get-user.query.ts


Commands
* Raises event SNS -> SQS
* A command can fire off another command but should not call itself from within service

  subscribe
  create
  update
  delete

e.g. create-user.command.ts
```
