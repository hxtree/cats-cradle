# .devcontainer

Incorporating dev containers further enhances the efficiency and security of our
development process. Dev containers encapsulate the development environment,
including dependencies and tools, within a containerized environment, ensuring
consistency across different machines and operating systems. This
standardization **MUST** simplify the onboarding process for new developers and
reduce the risk of configuration drift or compatibility issues.

The following Getting Started instructions explain how to develop locally using
a devcontainer.

1. Clone this repo using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:hxtree/cats-cradle
   ```

2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/),
   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the
   [Remote - Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)
   extension.

3. Open repo Project Folder using VSCode and build and connect to remote
   container.
